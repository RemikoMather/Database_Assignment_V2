# Database Assignment V2

## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental database concepts including SQL querying, database normalization, and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) design. The assignment showcases the progression from unnormalized data to a fully normalized relational database structure.

## Assignment Description
This database assignment covers three core areas of database management:

1. **SQL Querying**: Implementation of basic SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data
2. **Database Normalization**: Step-by-step demonstration of normalizing a database from 1NF through 3NF
3. **ERD Design**: Visual representation of the normalized database structure showing entities, attributes, and relationships

## What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases play a crucial role in data management by:

- **Data Storage**: Efficiently storing large amounts of information
- **Data Retrieval**: Providing quick access to specific data through queries
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency
- **Data Security**: Controlling access to sensitive information
- **Concurrent Access**: Allowing multiple users to access data simultaneously

## Database Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It improves database efficiency by:

- **Eliminating Data Redundancy**: Reducing duplicate data storage
- **Preventing Update Anomalies**: Ensuring consistent data updates
- **Minimizing Storage Space**: Optimizing database size
- **Improving Data Consistency**: Maintaining accurate relationships between data

## Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
ERDs are important in relational database design because they:

- **Visualize Database Structure**: Provide a clear picture of data relationships
- **Plan Database Design**: Help design efficient database schemas
- **Communicate Design**: Enable clear communication between stakeholders
- **Identify Issues**: Help spot potential design problems early
- **Document Relationships**: Show how different entities relate to each other

## Course Learning Outcomes

### 1. Database Structure in Data Management
This project demonstrates understanding of:
- Relational database concepts and terminology
- Table structures, primary keys, and foreign keys
- Data types and constraints
- Relationship types (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)

### 2. Querying and Presenting Data
The project showcases ability to:
- Write basic SQL SELECT statements
- Use WHERE clauses for filtering data
- Implement JOIN operations to combine tables
- Sort and group data for meaningful presentation

### 3. Efficient Relational Database Design
Demonstrates proficiency in:
- Applying normalization rules (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Creating efficient table structures
- Establishing proper relationships between entities
- Designing scalable database schemas

## Instructions

### Running the SQL Queries
1. Load the sample data using `data_sample.sql`
2. Execute queries from `queries.sql` in your preferred SQL environment
3. Review the results to understand data relationships

### Understanding Normalization
1. Read through `normalization.md` for step-by-step process
2. Compare the unnormalized vs. normalized table structures
3. Observe how normalization eliminates redundancy

### Viewing the ERD
1. Review `ERD_Description.txt` for detailed ERD specifications
2. Create the visual diagram using any ERD tool (Draw.io, Lucidchart, etc.)
3. Identify entities, attributes, and relationships

## Technologies Used
